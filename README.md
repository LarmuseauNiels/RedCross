 User information - TO DO's:
 - Menu dots missing in toolbar --> but toolbar should be a component (or something like that) because it's used in every page?
 - add column values to the html so page looks better
 - Add checks to see that everything that needs to be filled in, is filled in
 - Let the 'Next page' button do something meaningfull
 - Overall check of variable names and how to code things 'better/more nicely'
